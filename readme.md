I won't sync the sql over just yet, because I ended up dropping it by accident and never had a backup, so I have to crete the sql from scratch:


TODO:

- clean up code
- Use jquery for forms
- Better error system (I'll use ajax for this)
- Form validator. Too much redundant code being produced the way I am doing it at the moment.
- Better designs for FAQS, Following, Support system (add to issues for others)
- gettext translate //semi-done
- check bitcoin payments
- update user balance minus site fee
- add product //semi-done
- edit profile //semi-done
- scrolling images on product page
- advanced search //ish done
- on payment page show generated address with a timer
- wishlist /semi-done
- invoices
